# Financial_Analysis_Power_BI
This repository contains credit card usage and financial metrics of a banking institution 

**Project Background**

This project analyzes credit card usage and financial metrics for a banking institution using Power BI and DAX functions. The analysis focuses on calculating key financial metrics including running totals, moving averages, and growth rates to generate comprehensive KPIs. The system assesses customer behavior patterns, credit utilization trends, and delinquency risk factors to provide actionable insights. The goal is to improve customer retention strategies and enhance overall financial performance through data-driven decision making.

**Executive Summary**

This credit card analysis reveals critical insights across our banking institution, with over **18%** of clients showing high-risk utilization ratios above **80%** requiring immediate intervention. The analysis shows significant delinquency concerns with multiple clients showing missed payments, while approved loan customers receive **15%** higher credit limits than non-approved clients, indicating potential assessment bias. Analysis reveals dormant high-value accounts with **6+ months** of inactivity, inefficient customer acquisition costs where some segments show CAC nearly equal to customer lifetime value, and modest interest conversion rates despite substantial revolving balances. Premium cardholders demonstrate higher satisfaction scores compared to Basic card users, while sustained transaction growth indicates healthy portfolio momentum. The findings provide actionable recommendations for risk management, revenue optimization, and data-driven credit policies to strengthen financial performance and customer retention.
