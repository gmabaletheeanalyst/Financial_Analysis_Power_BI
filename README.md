# Financial_Analysis_Power_BI
This repository contains credit card usage and financial metrics of a banking institution using DAX Expressions

**Project Background**

This project analyzes credit card usage and financial metrics for a banking institution using Power BI and DAX functions. The analysis focuses on calculating key financial metrics including running totals, moving averages, and growth rates to generate comprehensive KPIs. The system assesses customer behavior patterns, credit utilization trends, and delinquency risk factors to provide actionable insights. The goal is to improve customer retention strategies and enhance overall financial performance through data-driven decision making.

**Executive Summary**

This credit card analysis reveals critical insights across our banking institution, with over **18%** of clients showing high-risk utilization ratios above **80%** requiring immediate intervention. The analysis shows significant delinquency concerns with multiple clients showing missed payments, while approved loan customers receive **15%** higher credit limits than non-approved clients, indicating potential assessment bias. Analysis reveals dormant high-value accounts with **6+ months** of inactivity, inefficient customer acquisition costs where some segments show CAC nearly equal to customer lifetime value, and modest interest conversion rates despite substantial revolving balances. Premium cardholders demonstrate higher satisfaction scores compared to Basic card users, while sustained transaction growth indicates healthy portfolio momentum. The findings provide actionable recommendations for risk management, revenue optimization, and data-driven credit policies to strengthen financial performance and customer retention.

**Spending Patterns and Customer Engagement**
Our 4-week moving average analysis demonstrates remarkable stability in customer spending behavior, providing us with a powerful tool to identify emerging trends before they become problematic. This consistency allows our risk management team to spot early warning signs of changing credit appetites or liquidity constraints, enabling proactive intervention strategies.

**Growth Metrics Reveal Strategic Opportunities**
Month-over-month and week-over-week growth analysis has uncovered significant behavioral shifts that demand immediate investigation. These fluctuations present opportunities to understand campaign effectiveness, seasonal impacts, and potential customer churn indicators, allowing us to optimize our marketing investments and retention strategies.

**Risk Management Requires Immediate Attention**
Our analysis reveals concerning delinquency patterns with a substantial portion of our client base showing missed payments and escalating credit risk. This situation demands immediate implementation of proactive customer support programs and enhanced repayment assistance initiatives to protect our portfolio value.

**Acquisition Cost Structure Needs Performance Alignment**
Current customer acquisition costs appear standardized across our customer base regardless of individual transaction contributions, suggesting the need for performance-based acquisition benchmarks that align spending with projected customer lifetime value.
